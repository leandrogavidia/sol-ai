This website is a demonstration of the first artificial intelligence assistant specialized in Solana. On the left, you can ask questions to AI models like Gemini or Chat-GPT, while on the right you can consult **Sol AI** to compare current information about the Solana ecosystem.

The site connects to the [**Sol AI API**](https://github.com/leandrogavidia/sol-ai-api), which provides the necessary context to answer questions through structured open-source documentation.
